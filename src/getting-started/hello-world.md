# Hello, world!

Now that you have Doggoscript installed, let's write a simple program to get you started.

Create a new file called `hello.ds`. This will be our program.

```
print("Hello, world!")
```

Now, run the program with the following command:

```bash
$ Doggoscript hello.do
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, world!
```

Congratulations! You've just written your first Doggoscript program!
