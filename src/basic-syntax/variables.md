# Variables

Variables are used to store values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

Variables need to be declared with the keyword `val`, and the name needs to start with a `$`.

Changing the value of a variable does not need to be done with the `val` keyword.

Instead of the `=` sign, you need to use the keyword `is`.

Example:

```
val $dog is "cute" // $dog can now be accessed throughout the program

$dog is "good"     // $dog is now "good". Note that the val keyword is not used.
```
