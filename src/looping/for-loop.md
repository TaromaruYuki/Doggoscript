# For Loop

A for loop is used to execute a block of code a certain number of times. It is often used to iterate over a list.

A for loop has a starting value, and ending value, and a step. The step is optional and defaults to 1.

Example:

```
for $i in 0..10 {
    print($i)
}
```

Example with step:

```
for $i in 0..10..2 {
    print($i)
}
```
